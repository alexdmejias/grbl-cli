# grbl-cli

# WORK IN PROGRESS
- use at your own risk
- not tested with any other machine other than my own
- has bugs
- does not have tests
- wrote in a single day, so the code is not pretty
- not a proper npm module yet

# What is this?
A WIP CLI way to send files to your GRBL machine. Clone, `npm install`, and run `node index.js help`
